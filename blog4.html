<h2>Hi World. Let's chat.</h2>
<p>17 Feb 2021</p>
<p>Hi there. It's nice to meet you. </p>

  <p>What is love? Once it was thought to be inflicted by the Gods on men and women, now in our more scientific approach, it is a mixture of chemicals in the brain and body. Either way, it's a powerful emotion, capable of changing the courses of many lives.</p>
  <p>The process of love is complicated, and ultimately, uncontrollable. The process of creating social order is completley controllable - the institution of marriage is one powerful mechanism to accomplish social order between men and women. Historically, by which I mean pre-Enlightenment, pre-Renaissance society, marriage was merely an arrangement between a man and a woman to procreate and raise children. Since the Enlightenment, there has been an attempt to "democratize" this institution. In the sense that the man and the woman get to choose thier own partners by themselves, or least have some say in it. </p>
  <p>This has been a failure. Because it is overtaken by Romantic emotion, erotic love. These emotions have little to do with the hard work of running a marriage: which is akin to running a small, serious, life-sustaining family business. </p>
  <p>In an ideal world, Romantic love would overlap with the mechanical and un-sexy business of running a marriage. But Romantic love is an unbridled horse, fickle, maybe dangerous. </p>
  <p> We do not live in Utopia. Choosing Romance as the leader, is choosing an untrained and unbridled horse to to drive your carriage. It will soon drive you over a cliff. Maybe it already has. </p>

 <p>Courtesans are trained professionals: usings the emotions of love to direct men and women towards a constructed social order. </p>
